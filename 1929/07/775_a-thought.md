# A Thought

The keys of mirth may become less musical as they grow older, but they are returned, and their former strains reproduced by the merry laugh of a little child. Just so do the keys of conscience become flat through lack of use, but if played upon in the spirit of a child, their tone is very clear, and may later be heard in notes of heavenly music.——_A. Henderson._
