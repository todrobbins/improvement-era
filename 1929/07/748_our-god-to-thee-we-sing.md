# Our God, to Thee We Sing

```
Our God, to Thee we sing,
We honor Thee as king,
  Greatest of all.
May Thy will now be done,
Soon may Thy kingdom come,
Established by Thy Son,
  Never to fall.

Lord, send Thy snow-white dove,
Emblem of all above,
  Pure love and peace,
Turning all hearts to Thee.
Nations and men agree,
Peace reign o'er land and sea,
  Never to cease.

Christ reign as King of kings,
His voice o'er earth then rings
  Like radio,
Setting His people free,
Converted they shall be.
When all His wounds they see,
  Their King they'll know.
