# Understanding

```
When life began to polish off my corners,
  And grind them down, I thought it very hard.
I did not understand the severe methods,
  Nor did I glimpse the final sweet reward.

But as each roughened spot is cut and rounded.
  I come to see more clearly, and to know,
The methods of the Jeweler's great labors,
  Who polishes a stone that it may show.

Its facets gleaming pure; reflecting brightly
  The work that He had done, and showing Him
To be the perfect workman, and that He has
  Ground and polished such a perfect gem.

And though the process may be far from pleasant.
  If every corner broken makes more bright
My soul, then I'll reflect in patient waiting
  The radiant beams of Heaven; it is right.
