# Faith Without Works is Dead

```
"O ye of little faith, why stand in doubt,
Can you not see that love's the cause
Of every act, that nothing moves without?
That every truth is based on laws:
Without a cause the world would cease to move,
The sun and moon would never shine,
Life were not worth the living without love,
Death (without hope and faith ) were yours and mine.
There is no limit to the strength and power
Of faith and hope (love's willing slaves)
We but exist unless dear love is ours,
This principle of life is all that saves.
"All things are possible if we believe;"
Doubting, we fail ere we begin;
Why entertain a doubt——ourselves deceive,
We must believe if we would win.
"And now abide faith, hope and love, these three,"
And an eternal life ahead;
Without these attributes we are not free——
To the extent we lack, are dead——
Increase your faith, hope, love, while it is day,
While it is day, walk in the light.
All these material things will fade away,
The day's far spent, soon comes the night.
Membership in churches cannot save us,
Too often they provide excuse to shirk.
Mere faith alone can but deprave us,
"But if ye love me, ye will do my work."
