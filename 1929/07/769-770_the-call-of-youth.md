# The Call of Youth

By Clara Horne Park

```
The river Woe, with noiseless tread,
On bold Destruction's errand sped,
And with alluring, sinuous grace.
Enticed the youth of every race
To follow down its rose-strewn way,
And give their lives to pleasures gay.

Another pathway, marked by stone,
Led up from Woe to heights unknown.
Where, as a beacon, clear and bright,
Shone Truth's divine, inspiring light;
To guide the earnest-minded youth
Who passed Temptation, seeking Truth.

A Youth stood on the brink of Woe,
Not knowing just which way to go——
Adown the river surged a crowd,
With voices calling clear and loud;
"Come join our song! Come sing our lay!
We live and laugh and love, today!"

Temptation urged, "We'll join them, friend,
I have a thousand francs to spend."
Then with persuasion whispered he.
"I know the way, come follow me,
Together we will drift along
And join this singing, joyous throng.
Their way is t'ward the City Bliss,
You'd give your soul, they say, for this."

The Youth turned eyes of beauty keen
Upon the grandeur of the scene,
And longing filled his youthful heart
Of that mad throng to be a part.

One step toward eternal woe,
Temptation bade him onward go:
But by his side a friend in need
Cried, "Do not thus the Tempter heed,
For his real plan you'll never know
Until disgraced by those below.
Then. Youth, alas, 'twill be too late
To seek for Heaven's redeeming gate.
For sin and mock'ry enter not
The sacred realm of Heaven's plot."
Thus Truth endeavored to restrain
And save a soul from grief and pain.

Youth looked once more upon the throng,
In beauty's dress, with mirthful song.
He stood irresolute, forlorn,
He visioned beauty yet unborn
To his young inexperienced eye.
"I cannot let this chance pass by
To taste the joy of Life." quoth he.
"Do thou come. Truth, along with me."

But Truth of Wisdom was a part
And followed not a wav'ring heart.
"I have a greater work to do,
And I have need, O Youth, of you."
But Youth heard not,——his eyes had seen,——
His senses revelled in a dream.

He saw himself a leader proud,
A King amongst that reckless crowd;
He'd go their way, of Life he'd learn,
And when he'd seen enough, he'd turn
And bring them back, yes, every one.
To where their journey had begun.
For Truth there waiting still would be
To guide them through Eternity.

Temptation, smiling, led the way
To join the crowd of singers gay.

Youth neared the throng, his head erect,
For he must seem of the elect,——
To show them all a King he'd make
If they would but his guidance take.
But what was that? A woman sank
Upon the rose-strewn river bank.
It seemed to Youth the crowd should wait.
But what cared they to know her fate!
Some turned and threw a mocking kiss,
"We'll meet you at the City Bliss."

She waved away Youth's proffered aid.
"Where wert thou going, Youth?" She laid
A withered hand upon his own,
While from her lips escaped a moan.
"You're not of us, your soul is free
To choose your path. You must leave me,
For I no longer care to go
And join the crowd in Bliss below."

"Come thou with me," Youth grandly said.
"Nay, I am numbered with the dead."

The face she lifted to his own.
Was one where beauty once had shone;
But now the haggard, wasted look
Of sin and suff'ring, he mistook
For age. The call of Death was there,——
The hopelessness of deep despair.
Fast sinking in Woe's seething tide,
With hands outstretched to Youth, she cried,
"If thou, O Youth, dost heed the call
Of him, the Tempter, thou wilt fall
As I have done, and never rise
To heights of Glory. Be thou wise,——
Go back to Truth, thou still art free,
Go back! Or thou wilt be like me."

Temptation lingered, urging,
"Son, Our way to Bliss has just begun."
And pointed to the heedless crowd
Far down Woe's course; with voices loud,
Still mocking, jesting on they went,
As though on demon's errand bent.

He saw once more the City Bliss——
A tawdry shell! "Would I for this
My soul forsake, my freedom give?
My everlasting chance to live,
Achieve and love my fellow-men?
If I do this, what have I then?"

Youth drew his eyes away from Sin,
And turned, to see a light begin
To glow upon the woman's face.
Her form now clothed with beauty's grace
Was standing by his side, alight
With beauty dazzling to his sight.
Youth recognized the soul within,——

"O Truth," he cried, "how near to Sin
I came. And but for thee I'd now
At cruel Temptation's alter bow!"

Truth smiled and pointed to the light.
"Do thou, O Youth, keep that in sight,
Let Truth and Wisdom guide thy way——
They lead to Everlasting Day."
