# An Evening Prayer

```
Both of my babies are sleeping.
  My treasures are safe and at rest.
Breathing so softly and sweetly,
  The birds now secure in their nest.

Cuddled down warm in their blankets.
  Heads pillowed on chubby round arms.
Faces serene in their sleeping,
  No worry is theirs, no alarms.

Innocence, purity, sweetness.
  Is given me here to keep rare.
Help me and guide me, dear Father.
  To keep safe these gifts, is my prayer.
```
