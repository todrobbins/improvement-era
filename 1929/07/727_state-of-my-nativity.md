# State of My Nativity

```
State of my nativity.
Proud!——proud am I of you!
Of your sinking, golden gladness,
Of your sky's own flawless hue!
Of your wealth of surging waters,
O'er which wide-winged sea-birds roam,
Finding on your wave-girt islands
Haven for a nesting-home——
Of your might of regal mountains,
Towering high on every side,
Holding wonders of the ages
In their canyons deep and wide!
Proud of the intrepid mortals
Who have bade you yield your best——
Placed the rose upon your bosom,
Where once Cacti drained your breast!

Other climes may lure me thither,
For a time, may glamour cast
O'er my beauty-craving spirit.
But not long their charm may last;
Comes a day when heart throbs quiver
With keen pangs of longing pain.
Till my steps are homeward wended,
Where my love and pride remain!
State of my nativity,
Shrined is your every grace.
And echoed are the words of him
Who once said——"This is the place."
