# Stars and Stripes

```
What do you see when the flag goes by,
That your hat comes off and your head goes high?
What are your thoughts as you see it wave.
As though by the breath of the boys who gave
Their all in all that it still might be
The world's high trust in Liberty?

In Argonne's shade, where the whining steel
Left a path of dead for the giant's heel.
A khaki lad felt the sting of lead.
And groaned in the dust while his clothes turned red.

An eternity passed that afternoon,
And the lad grew wise and old too soon.
Humanity trooped through his fevered brain,
Pleading relief from the Tyrant's reign.

Man's unjust acts to his fellow-man,
Down through the age since the earth began,
All were his in that cosmic hour,
Till his anguished soul cried out for power
To cleanse the earth from its sin and strife,
And replace therefor the abundant life
Of Peace and Love and Loyalty,
Where those who serve are royalty.

As dusk creeps o'er the dead-strewn field,
A rescue corps, by the dark concealed,
Placed a friendly hand on the fevered brow,
And were pledged that night to a sacred vow.

"Take this little flag," the sufferer said,
"Bullet pierced, with blood soaked red.
And dye each alternate stripe to be,
That each new flag becomes part of me.
Leave some stripes clean and pure and white,
Unspotted still for our nation's light.
In the corner there fling a field of blue,
With God's own stars still shining through.
Then build a pole of the nation's strength.
* Run my flag to the top * * full length *
Before OLD GLORY * * let my people bow,
* * *
Yes, * * Yes, Dear God, I am ready now *."

What do you see when the flag goes by,
That your hat comes off and your head goes high?
What are your thoughts when you see it wave.
As though by a breath from an Argonne grave?
