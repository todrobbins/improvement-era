# Crosses

```
Christ carried His cross to Calvary,
With his body bended, aching, sore.
He sipped the gall, the thistles wore;
For a sinning world the pain He bore.
  When He carried His cross to Calvary.

We'll carry a cross to Calvary,
But because of pain the Master stood,
Ours may be fashioned of lighter wood.
He took the heavy one for man's good.
  When He carried His cross to Calvary.

But many that go toward Calvary
Are not content with the cross of old.
They want one fashioned out of gold.
But, oh, it will cut and be hard to hold
  As they journey on to Calvary.
