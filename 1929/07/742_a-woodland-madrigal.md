# A Woodland Madrigal

```
Hark! How the song birds in the grove
Embowered in roses, sing their tender love!
'Tis here kind Nature in her rosy bowers
Bids Love awaken us amid the flowers,
Inspiring us in tones of merry glee
To sing our song of Love's sweet harmony!

List! How the finch and mocking-bird attune
Their melody to this clear morn in June!

Sing, merry birds, express whatever seems
To you the dearest thought of summer dreams!
Could Man as happily his voice intone——
Each voice impassioned for his love alone——
Like pealing organs he would voice employ
To fill the firmament with tones of joy!
