# Temples

```
For man to build a temple made with hands,
The noblest tree that in the forest stands
Must fall before the woodman's axe and saw;
Destroying forms, to build anew, is Cosmic Law.

Man's body is his temple, built by thought,
For every virile thought must leave its trace;
Some day each soul shall ask, What hast thou wrought?
Can we this urgent question, fearless, face?

But "On the Heights" a nobler Temple stands,
Not built by mortal thought or human hands;
In which no sound of axe or tool was heard
'Twas spoken into Being by the Word.

With these two temples blended into one,
Attained is evolution's goalâ€”the Real;
God's work and man's on this earth being done,
With other stars, God sets on this His seal.
